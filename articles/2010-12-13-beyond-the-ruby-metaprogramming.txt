title: Beyond the Ruby metaprogramming
date: 14/12/2010

Here is a collection of very cool Ruby libs which extend Ruby’s metaprogramming and object model operation very much:

[object2module](https://github.com/banister/object2module) — Convert Classes and Objects to Modules so they can be extended/included

[remix](https://github.com/banister/remix) — A library to give you total control over class and module ancestor chains

[prepend](https://github.com/banister/prepend) — Prepends modules in front of a class; so method lookup starts with the module

[local\_eval](https://github.com/banister/local_eval) — Object#instance__eval without changing self 

[include\_complete](https://github.com/banister/include_complete) — Use Module#include__complete to bring in singleton classes from modules

[mixico](https://github.com/rkh/mixico) -- Disable and re-enable mixins
